		After a painful breakup, many women believe they’ll never find love again. But for 48-year-old web designer Barbarella Buchner, finding another man after her seven-year relationship ended has been the last thing on her mind – because she believes she’s found happiness, companionship and emotional fulfilment with… her cats.

Cat-mad Barbarella has always been an animal lover. "As a child I was surrounded by cats," she says. "Our family regularly owned at least one or two. They were my favourite animal."
